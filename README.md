## Backgammon-Game
#Single file Backgammon Game, with simple GUI in terminal, early stage of studies project
Manual of the game:
1. The goal of the game is to place all of your checkers in your home board and then bear them off (remove them from the board).
2. The player who bears off all of their checkers from the board first wins.
3. The game begins with the proper arrangement of checkers on the board.
4. Red (*) moves checkers clockwise, white (&) moves checkers counterclockwise.
5. At the start, players roll one die each, and the player with the higher roll goes first.
6. The first player then rolls two dice and moves their checkers the corresponding number of spaces.
7. Each of the two dice allows the movement of one checker (move a checker a number of spaces equal to the number on the die).
8. It is allowed to move one checker the sum of the numbers on the two dice, provided at least one intermediate point (from one die) is unoccupied.
9. A player can move a checker only to an empty point or a point occupied only by their own checkers or a point occupied by a single opposing checker (this results in a hit).
10. A player cannot place a checker on a point with more than one opposing checker.
11. If a player has no legal moves corresponding to one of the dice, the player forfeits their turn.
12. If a player cannot make any move, they lose their turn.
13. Rolling the same value on both dice is called a double.
14. When rolling the same number on both dice (denoted as "a"), the player can make four moves of value "a."
    For example, if both dice show two pips, the player can: move one checker eight spaces, or move two checkers four spaces each, or move two checkers two spaces and one checker four spaces, or move four checkers, each two spaces.
15. Hitting occurs when a player moves a checker to a point occupied by a single opposing checker.
16. A hit opponent's checker is placed on the bar.
17. A player whose checker is on the bar cannot make moves with checkers on the board (points 1-24) until they have borne off all their checkers from the bar.
18. Checkers from the bar are borne off to the opponent's home board.
19. They can be placed on an unoccupied point or a point occupied only by a single opposing checker.
20. After rolling two dice, one die is selected, and the number of pips on that die determines the distance from the board's end for bearing off.
21. If the opponent has at least two checkers on each point in their home board, it is not possible to bear off checkers from the bar, and the player forfeits their turn.
22. The same applies when both points indicated by the dice are in possession of the opponent (i.e., at least two checkers on each of these points).
23. Bearing off checkers is possible when all the remaining checkers are in the player's home board.
24. If a player has one checker outside the home board and the others inside, and if a move with one die is sufficient to bear off that checker, the other die can be used to bear off one of the checkers from inside to outside.
25. Checkers can be borne off if they are on points distant from the end by the number of pips rolled.
26. If the number of pips on the die is greater than the distance of the farthest checker from the end, the player bears off their farthest checker.
27. Once a checker is borne off, it does not return to the board.
28. Players can play not only individual games but entire matches (series of games).
29. One point is scored for each victory.
30. If a player bears off all their checkers before the opponent manages to bear off at least one, the player receives an additional point.
31. However, if the opponent has at least one checker on the bar, the winner receives three points for the victory.
32. In the basic variant (not considered within the project), players use a so-called doubling cube. Using this cube multiplies the number of points earned for a victory by the value indicated on the cube (2, 4, ..., 64).
